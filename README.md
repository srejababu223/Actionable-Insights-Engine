# IoT Operational Efficiency Engine

### 🚀 Overview
This project is a technical solution designed to identify operational waste in real-time. By analyzing data from IoT-connected assets, this logic engine flags "Idle Waste"—assets that are powered on but not performing productive work.

### 💼 Business Value (ROI)
* **Cost Reduction:** Instantly identifies fuel and electricity wastage.
* **Proactive Alerts:** Shifts operations from manual monitoring to "Exception-Based" management.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Provides exact dollar-amounts of lost revenue per asset.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Logic:** Conditional filtering of real-time sensor streams.
* **Scalability:** Designed to be integrated with Webhooks (Flask) or cloud-based APIs.

* Note on Industry Versatility: While this prototype uses IoT telemetry as the data source, the core logic is industry-agnostic and can be easily reconfigured for Fintech fraud detection, CRM lead scoring, or Cyber Security threat monitoring.
