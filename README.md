# IoT Operational Efficiency Engine

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a technical solution designed to identify operational waste in real-time. By analyzing data from IoT-connected assets, this logic engine flags **"Idle Waste"**—assets that are powered on but not performing productive work.

## 💼 Business Value (ROI)
* **Cost Reduction:** Instantly identifies fuel and electricity wastage.
* **Proactive Alerts:** Shifts operations from manual monitoring to "Exception-Based" management.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Provides exact dollar-amounts of lost revenue per asset.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Logic:** Conditional filtering of real-time sensor streams.
* **Scalability:** Designed to be integrated with Webhooks (Flask) or cloud-based APIs.

## 🔄 Industry Agility
While this prototype uses IoT telemetry as the primary data source, the core logic is industry-agnostic. The engine is architected to be pivoted to other high-value use cases in minutes, such as:
* **Cyber Security:** Flagging "Impossible Travel" login attempts.
* **Fintech:** Detecting anomalous transaction patterns.
* **Sales Ops:** Identifying high-value leads that have stalled in the CRM.
